## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hi! I am a dedicated and enthusiastic **Python** developer with a strong interest in **machine learning** and **deep learning**. I've also had a long-standing interest in **Natural Language Processing**, which has been a significant area of my competence. My extensive knowledge of these subjects, as well as practical experience applying their concepts to a variety of projects, have driven my interest for them. I regard myself as a dedicated, punctual, and truthful individual that is always eager to learn and take on new challenges.
