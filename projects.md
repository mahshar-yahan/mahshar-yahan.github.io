## GenreGenius: Multiclass Classification
---

* Technologies/Tools: SKLearn, Pandas, Numpy
* Github URL: [Project](https://github.com/mahshar-yahan/Multiclass-Book-Classification)
* Goals and Objectives of the project: <br>
    We fine-tuned the Bangla BERT Large model to predict book genres from Bengali summaries. Using a dataset of 4.5K summaries labeled into seven genres (Fiction, Thriller, Children’s Books, Political, Sci-Fi, War, Motivational), this project bridges the gap in Bengali AI-driven book recommendations, helping readers discover new genres effortlessly. We have achieved accuracy of 83.56%.

## FingerMatch Cricket: A Gesture-Based Game 
---

* Technologies/Tools: Mediapipe, OpenCV, Tensorflow
* Github URL: [Project](https://github.com/mahshar-yahan/Gesture-Cricket)
* Goals and Objectives of the project: <br>
    FingerMatch Cricket is an interactive game that leverages hand gestures to simulate a cricketmatch. Using MediaPipe, the game detects the number of fingers shown by the player. The objective is simple: if the player and the computer display the same number of fingers, the player is out. Otherwise, the player’s run count increases.

## TokenTagger: Name Entity Recognition
---

* Technologies/Tools: Transformers, Pandas, Numpy
* Github URL: [Project](https://github.com/mahshar-yahan/Keyword-Extraction-BERT)
* Goals and Objectives of the project: <br>
    TokenTagger leverages BERT to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) by fine-tuning on the CoNLL-2003 dataset. It aligns tokenized inputs with labels to improve NER tag predictions and utilizes the seqeval metric to compute precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. This model aims to enhance the accuracy of token classification tasks in real-world applications. Here we have achieved the accuracy of 97.32%

## CloudTask Optimizer: Performace Analysis of Task Scheduling Algorithm
---

* Technologies/Tools: FCFS, SJF, SVM, Linear Regression, Random Forest
* Github URL: [Project](https://github.com/mahshar-yahan/-Performance-Analysis-of-Task-Scheduling-Algorithms-in-Cloud-Computing-)
* Goals and Objectives of the project: <br>
     CloudTask Optimizer analyzes the efficiency of task scheduling algorithms in cloud computing. By comparing FCFS, SJF, and Priority Scheduling, alongside machine learning models like random forest, decision tree, and linear regression, the project assesses delay times and execution efficiency, highlighting SJF minimal delay advantage and Priority Scheduling effectiveness with correct prioritization.

## ExploreHub: Your Travel Companion
---

* Technologies/Tools: Dart, Flutter, Firebase
* Github URL: [Project](https://github.com/mahshar-yahan/Travel-App)
* ExploreHub is a user-friendly travel app that provides detailed information about various travel destinations. Users can explore different places, leave comments, and like interesting destinations.

##  MediScript: A digital Prescription System
---

* Technologies/Tools: PHP, HTML, Bootstrap, MySQL
* Github URL: [Project]
* MediScript is a PHP-based system designed for doctors to create digital prescriptions, enabling patients to access them anytime. The platform includes features such as secure login/logout, report uploads,
patient file management, and an appointment booking system, streamlining healthcare management for both doctors and patients.
